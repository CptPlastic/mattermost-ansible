# To Do List

### Distrubution Ports
I want to create a branch for each of the following distros that edits the relevant sections so that the playbook can be run on multiple operating systems.
I think that this is preferable to creating one large playbook that uses lots of logic but I am open to changing that. 

- [x] Ubuntu 14.04
- [ ] Ubuntu 16.04
- [ ] Red Hat (CentOS) 6
- [ ] Red Hat (CentOS) 7

If you care to port the playbook to any of these distros, submit a PR.
